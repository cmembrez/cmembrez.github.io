            "I am a software engineer focusing on digital twin in an industrial context, with constant curiosity to apply my skills in other industries.",
            "During a MSc in computer science, with a specialization in advanced information processing, I have been inspired by the potential of mixed reality and what it can unlock. I wrote my MSc thesis on gamification and accessibility using augmented reality to support the rehabilitation of people with visual impairment.",
            "Through these studies, I have reconnected with a passion for computer science and video games. It brought back memories from my childhood where I developed maps for Half-Life using  the Valve Hammer editor. But today, with the appropriate skills acquired,  I tackle new hardware and technologies with a purpose to bring the best out of mixed reality  to benefit the end user in multiple ways.",
            "My initial career in financial investments helped me develop a rigorous work ethic through an attention to details with complex data to make optimal decisions, and a strong communication with interpersonal skills through presentations across Europe."
